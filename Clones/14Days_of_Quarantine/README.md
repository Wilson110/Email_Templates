# The #14Days_of_Quarantine Project

## Description
This project was created by me during a period of national quarantine in the USA. To keep me productive as an email developer, I will code a HTML template clone of an email I receive that I like daily for this project.

## Contents
1. **Day One - QBC**: A clone based on a Quarantine Book Club announcement I received in the Email Weekly newsletter delivered on March 17, 2020. Visit their site [here](https://www.quarantinebookclub.com) to see the design that inspired this clone.

2. **Day Two - ABA**: A clone based on A Book Apart email I received delivered on March 19, 2020. View the original email [here](https://www.getdrip.com/deliveries/w7p2ri1u4wita8ffl2tu) to see the design that inspired this clone.
