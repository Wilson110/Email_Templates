# The #14Days_of_Quarantine Project

## Description
This project was created by me during a period of national quarantine in the USA. To keep me productive as an email developer, I will code a HTML template clone of an email I receive that I like daily for this project.

## Contents
1. **Day One - QBC**: A clone based on a Quarantine Book Club announcement I received in the Email Weekly newsletter delivered on March 17, 2020. To learn more about the Quarantine Book Club, visit their site [here](https://www.quarantinebookclub.com).

## Dev Notes
1. For creative, non-commercial use. 
2. Email client testing recommended before deployment.
