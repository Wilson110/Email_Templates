# The #14Days_of_Quarantine Project

## Description
This project was created by me during a period of national quarantine in the USA. To keep me productive as an email developer, I will code a HTML template clone of an email I receive during the 14 or more business days I'm in quarantine for this project.

## Contents
1. **Day One - QBC**: A responsive email clone based on a Quarantine Book Club announcement I received in the Email Weekly newsletter delivered on March 17, 2020. Visit their site [here](https://www.quarantinebookclub.com) to see the design that inspired this clone.

2. **Day Two - ABA**: A responsive email clone based on A Book Apart email I received on March 19, 2020.

3. **Day Three - The Well**: A clone based on "Thrive", an email newsletter of curated topics for Black women in business that I received from The Well on March 4, 2020. For this HTML template, I imported the Foundation for Emails framework by Zurb, so the CSS code structure will look different. Please also note that the framework's CSS classes were implemented. Learn more about The Well community [here](https://www.the-well-space.com) and subscribe to "Thrive" to see the design that inspired this clone.
